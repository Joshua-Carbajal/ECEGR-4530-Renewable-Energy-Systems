# ECEGR-4530-Renewable-Energy-Systems

Course Description
Fundamentals of renewable energy conversion methods and the environmental, economic
and societal impact. Conversion methods studied include: solar photovoltaic, solar thermal
and wind. Integration of renewable resources into the bulk transmission system. Sustain-
ability and efficiency considerations.

A major focus of the course is to design and analyze a renewable energy system using the 
National Renewable Energy Lab's System Advisory Model (SAM). One of those requires using Python
to develop a model of a solar-powered system from parameters studied throughout the course.
